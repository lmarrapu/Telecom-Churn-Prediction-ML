# üì° ChurnEra - Predictive Modeling for Telecom Customer Retention üìä

## üåü Overview
**ChurnEra** is a machine learning-based project aimed at predicting customer churn in the **telecom sector**. Customer churn, or the loss of subscribers, poses significant challenges for telecom providers. This project leverages **statistical modeling** and **machine learning algorithms** to identify factors contributing to churn and predict whether a customer is likely to leave.  

By analyzing historical data and extracting meaningful patterns, **ChurnEra** provides actionable insights to improve **customer retention strategies** and optimize marketing efforts.

## üõ† Methodology

### 1. **Dataset**
- The dataset includes customer records with features such as **tenure**, **monthly charges**, **contract type**, and **payment method**.  
- The **target variable** indicates whether a customer has churned (binary classification).  

### 2. **Preprocessing**
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and inconsistencies.  
- **Normalization:** Standardized data for improved model performance.  
- **Encoding:** Converted categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like **one-hot encoding**.  
- **Data Splitting:** Divided the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets (70:30 ratio) with **stratified sampling** to preserve class proportions.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Univariate Analysis:** Analyzed individual features to understand their distribution and impact.  
- **Bivariate Analysis:** Explored relationships between variables using correlation heatmaps and scatter plots.  
- **Visualization:** Utilized bar charts, histograms, and box plots to identify patterns.  

### 4. **Feature Engineering**
- Created new features such as **customer tenure groups**, **contract length categories**, and **payment method flags**.  
- Applied statistical metrics like **skewness** and **kurtosis** to uncover data characteristics.  

### 5. **Model Selection**
- Tested multiple machine learning models, including:  
  - **Logistic Regression** - Baseline performance.  
  - **Random Forest** - Ensemble learning for robust predictions.  
  - **Gradient Boosting** - Sequential learning to improve weak classifiers.  
  - **XGBoost** - Optimized boosting algorithm for high performance.  

### 6. **Model Optimization**
- Fine-tuned hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV** for improved accuracy.  
- Evaluated performance with **cross-validation** to minimize overfitting.
